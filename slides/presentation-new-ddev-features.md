## Things we're proud of in DDEV

- Maintenance! I'm very proud that we do our best to keep up with all the crazy changes around us.
  - PHP8.5 will be in DDEV before it is released.
  - New Database versions like PostGreSQL 18 show up in DDEV within days of release.
- Support: We think we have world-class support, better than almost any commercial organization.
  - Support requests and bugs are responded to quickly in Discord and GitHub.

### Maintenance and Support Examples:
  - Bitnami took all their images away but we were prepared beforehand and not directly affected.
  - MariaDB decided to completely break their mysqldump format in a patch release, but we had a fix within hours. A lot of people never even knew about this catastrophe that spread all over the web because DDEV worked around it so fast.
